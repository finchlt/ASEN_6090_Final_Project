ASEN6090 Final Project

Summary: Generate a parameter indicating snow cover on GPS antenna.

* Primary Sites 
  * P360
    * Tracks Used: Make skyplot first.
      * include L2c sats too
  * P101 (?)
  * AB33 (Buried Feb 5-10)
  * P455k

* Parameters considered
  * Truth: Digital site pictures
  * MP1 -> Kyle
  * SNR -> Direct signal power -> Logan
  * LSP (periodograms) -> Periodograms
    Doesnt seem useful at this point

* Days under consideration
  * February 2012 
    * with snow on antenna: 21 
      * 1PM MST (UTC - 7)
      * GPS Week: 1676 | Day of Week: 2
    * cloudy, but no snow on antenna: 22 
      * 1PM MST  (UTC - 7)
      * GPS Week: 1676 | Day of Week: 3
 
* Timeline
   * 04/13 - Class Presentation
   * Week I
     * Look at parameters seperately
       * try to arrive at a heuristic thresholding method with/without snow cover.

* Notes
  * Data files taken from ftp://garner.ucsd.edu/pub/
